## üìÇ Projects  

### üîπ Ransomware Detection using Image-based Representation of Portable Executable Headers  
- **Company/Role:** Final Project ‚Äì University of Lagos, Nigeria  
- **Date:** August 2024  
- **Skills/Technologies:** *`Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Python, Machine Learning, AI, Malware`*
- **Tasks:**  
  - Developed a deep learning‚Äìbased malware detection system that visualizes PE headers of `.exe` files as color images for classification.  
  - Trained and compared three CNN architectures: **ResNet**, **Xception**, and **VGG16** to detect and classify ransomware families.  
  - Facilitated feature extraction from PE headers without extensive format familiarity, reducing processing burden and countering evasion tactics.  
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.

### üîπ OSINT Signals Classifier & Synthesizer  
- **Company/Role:** OSINT Security Engineer ‚Äì OpenQQuantify  
- **Date:** March 2025  
- **Skills/Technologies:** *`GNU Radio, Python, Machine Learning`*
- **Tasks:**  
  - Developed a synthetic signal classification system spanning the entire radio spectrum (ELF to EHF) to classify synthetic signals based on features extracted from real-world signals.  
  - Utilized **GNU Radio** for synthetic signal generation across various modulation schemes and channel conditions, and **Python** for automation, machine learning, and data processing.  
  - Trained and validated machine learning models for accurate synthetic signal classification and integrated all modules into a cohesive system.
