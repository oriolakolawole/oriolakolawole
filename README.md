## üìÇ Projects  

### üîπ Ransomware Detection using Image-based Representation of Portable Executable Headers  
- **Company/Role:** Final Project ‚Äì University of Lagos, Nigeria  
- **Date:** August 2024  
- **Skills/Technologies:** *`Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Python, Machine Learning, AI`*
- **Tasks:**  
  - Developed a deep learning‚Äìbased malware detection system that visualizes PE headers of `.exe` files as color images for classification.  
  - Trained and compared three CNN architectures: **ResNet**, **Xception**, and **VGG16** to detect and classify ransomware families.  
  - Facilitated feature extraction from PE headers without extensive format familiarity, reducing processing burden and countering evasion tactics.  
  - Evaluated model performance using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F-measure, and AUC.
